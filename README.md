tipsCalc
========

Playing around with swift. A tip calculator.

Some of the code is a bit messy. I was worrying about functionality instead of code given my limited experience. Colors are also a bit gaudy.

Features
- Settings screen
  1. Change default tip values
  2. Change theme
- Locale specific currency but currency symbol will only be on the left side
- Saves your data for 10 minutes
- Saves your settings
